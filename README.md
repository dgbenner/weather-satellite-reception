# Meteor-M Highland Park Station

Live weather satellite imagery captured from Highland Park, St. Paul, Minnesota.

**Live Site:**  https://dgbenner.github.io/weather-satellite-reception/

## What This Is

A ground station receiving Low Rate Picture Transmission (LRPT) data from Russian polar-orbiting weather satellites as they pass overhead. Images show a continuous strip of Earth captured during each ~10 minute pass.

## Current Satellites

- **Meteor-M N°2-3** - 137.1 MHz
- **Meteor-M N°2-4** - 137.9 MHz

Typical coverage: 2-3 visible passes per day per satellite over Minneapolis-St. Paul area.

## Equipment

- **Receiver:** RTL-SDR Blog V3
- **Computer:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- **Antenna:** [TBD - temporary wire dipole for initial testing]
- **Software:** SatDump for decoding LRPT signals

## Technical Details

- **Image Resolution:** 0.6 miles/pixel
- **Transmission Protocol:** LRPT (Low Rate Picture Transmission)
- **Spectral Bands:** 3 channels (visible, near-infrared, infrared)
- **Ground Swath:** ~1,740 miles coverage width

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Current)
1. Pi Zero 2 W records raw RF during satellite passes
2. SD card transferred to Mac for processing
3. SatDump decodes LRPT signal into imagery
4. Processed images uploaded to GitHub Pages
5. Simple static gallery displays captures

### Phase 2: Automation (Future)
- Automated pass scheduling and recording
- Network file transfer
- Enhanced processing and annotations
- Additional metadata and analytics

## Image Coverage

Each image shows the satellite's ground track during a pass over North America, typically covering:
- Central/Western Canada
- US Midwest and Great Plains  
- Sometimes extending to Gulf of Mexico (depending on pass geometry)

Coverage maps generated by SatDump show the specific area imaged during each pass.

## Project Context

This is a companion project to:
- ADS-B Aircraft Tracking - monitoring aircraft with RTL-SDR
- Weather Satellite Computer Vision (planned) - analyzing cloud formations and weather patterns from captured imagery

Part of ongoing exploration of RF reception, signal processing, and data visualization.
